# Cyclistic Insights: Boosting Memberships Through Data Analytics

# Project Background
Cyclistic is a public bike-share program operating in Chicago since 2016, offering a network of over 5,800 bicycles and more than 600 docking stations citywide. The fleet includes a variety of bike types—standard, adaptive, and cargo models—designed to serve a broad population, including riders with physical disabilities.

The service accommodates two primary user types: casual riders, who pay per ride or per day, and annual members, who commit to longer-term usage. Casual riders tend to use the service for leisure, while members are more likely to rely on it for commuting and regular transportation.

Historically, Cyclistic has used a wide-reaching marketing strategy to attract users. However, internal financial reviews have shown that long-term members are more valuable to the company in terms of revenue and engagement. As a result, the marketing director, Lily Moreno, has tasked the analytics team with identifying behavioral differences between casual riders and members. The objective is to support a targeted campaign that encourages more casual users to transition into annual memberships through insights drawn from trip usage patterns and rider trends.

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
